            <p>If you talk about food just as much as you eat it, you're in good company. We've got famous chefs and
                stars—Julia Child, Sophia Loren, Virginia Woolf—to thank for some of the greatest food quotes of all
                time. Do what you will with these: Memorize them, pin them, or print them out and tack them up all over
                your kitchen.
